# Senior Seminar Project

This repository contains the code and data that will be used for my project. 

So far, I have started by collecting .csv/.xlsx data for land, corn prices, ethanol prices, weather, and other miscellaneous data. 

The script in the repository is a basic script using pandas, to extract data from the spreadsheets and load them into a dataframe. Once they are in the dataframes they are joinable and are easier to generate statistical values. I am currently using Jupyter to create these notebooks and interact with the visual outputs.
